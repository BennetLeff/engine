# engine (no name yet)
This is currently a C++ rewrite of the (incomplete) physics simulator I wrote in D. It's not up to the point I was at in D yet. Once I get to that point I will be adding in more features and making a more flushed out engine. This is 100% for fun at the moment so there will be some weird things going on inside.
